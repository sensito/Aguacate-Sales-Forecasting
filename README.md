## Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to forecast future avocado sales based on historical data. The project includes data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data of avocados.
- **Date:** The date of the sales record.
- **Region:** The region where the sales occurred.
- **Total Volume:** Total number of avocados sold.
- **Average Price:** Average price per avocado.
- **Type:** Conventional or organic avocados.

## Features
The notebook includes the following key features:
- **Data Exploration:** Initial analysis of the dataset to understand its structure and key characteristics.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creation of new features for better prediction.
- **Sales Forecasting Models:** Implementation of multiple models including:
  - ARIMA
  - SARIMAX
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluation of model performance using metrics like RMSE.
- **Visualization:** Visualization of actual vs. predicted sales over time.

## Modeling Approach
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Understanding the data trends and patterns.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Adding features such as lagged variables and rolling averages.
3. **Model Building:** Building and training different forecasting models.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Comparing models based on their performance metrics.
5. **Sales Prediction:** Generating predictions for future sales.


## Results
The models provide accurate forecasts for future avocado sales, helping businesses make data-driven decisions. Below are example visualizations from the project:
